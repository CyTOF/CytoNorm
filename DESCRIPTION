Description: This package can be used to normalize mass cytometry samples when 
             a control sample is taken along on each of the barcoded plates. 
             This is done by first identifying multiple clusters/cell types, 
             learning the batch effects from the control samples and applying
             quantile normalization on all markers of interest.
